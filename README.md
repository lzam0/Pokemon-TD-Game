This is my A level project, it combines aspects of pokemon and tower defence into one game. I wanted to come back to this project and fix some bugs and make the game feel more complete


Key Features:

Pokemon Theme: Immerse yourself in the captivating world of Pokemon, where familiar characters and creatures take on new roles in a tower defense setting.

Tower Defense Gameplay: Strategically place Pokemon towers along the path to defend against waves of enemy Pokemon. Each tower has unique abilities and strengths, allowing players to create custom defense strategies.

Object-Oriented Design: The game is built using OOP principles, making it modular, extensible, and easy to maintain. Classes such as PokemonTower, EnemyPokemon, and GameMap encapsulate specific functionalities, promoting code organization and reusability.

Python Graphics: Leveraging Python's graphical capabilities, the game features visually appealing graphics and animations that enhance the gaming experience. Players can enjoy vibrant Pokemon-themed visuals as they defend their territory.

Wave-based Challenges: Face increasingly challenging waves of enemy Pokemon as you progress through the game. Test your strategic skills and adaptability as you encounter new types of enemies and obstacles.

Upgradeable Towers: Earn in-game currency by defeating enemy waves and use it to upgrade your Pokemon towers. Enhance their abilities, unlock new attacks, and evolve them into powerful defenders.

User Interface: Enjoy a user-friendly interface that provides essential information such as tower statistics, enemy wave details, and in-game currency status. Intuitive controls make it easy for players to navigate and interact with the game.
